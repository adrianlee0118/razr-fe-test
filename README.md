## About

A light weight client-side app that does this:

![lookit](https://github.com/adrianlee0118/razr-fe-test/blob/master/assets/captured.gif)

The arrangement of squares and circles will always occur in a 50% frequency split but the sizes will be randomized and the whole group is always sorted in descending order of area. All sizes can be re-calculated and resorted by re-loading the browser.

Created with ReactJS and Sass using Create-React-App, and tested in Jest/Enzyme.
